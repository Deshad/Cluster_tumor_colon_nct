## Introduction

Clustering is a critical task in machine learning, particularly when working with high-dimensional data. This project investigates the clustering of feature representations extracted from deep learning modelsâ€”PathologyGAN, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and VGG16. These features, derived from 5,000 colorectal cancer tissue images, were analyzed using dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA and UMAP, followed by clustering.

Key metrics for evaluation:
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures cluster separation and cohesion.
- **V-Measure Score**: Evaluates clustering alignment with ground-truth labels.

## Methodology

### Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Retained the top 100 principal components with the highest variance.
- **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**: Reduced data to 100 components, capturing both local and global structures.

### Clustering Algorithms
1. **K-Means**: Partition-based clustering optimized by minimizing intra-cluster variance.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Agglomerative clustering using the Ward linkage method.
3. **Louvain Clustering**: A graph-based method for community detection optimized for modularity.

### Evaluation Framework
- Randomly sampled subsets of 200 points for K-Means and Louvain clustering.
- Larger subset of 1,000 points for Hierarchical clustering.
- Evaluation using Silhouette and V-Measure scores.

## Results

| Representation          | K-Means | Hierarchical Clustering | Louvain Clustering |
|--------------------------|---------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **VGG16 (UMAP)**         | 0.63    | 0.71                     | 0.67                |
| **VGG16 (PCA)**          | 0.63    | 0.58                     | 0.68                |
| **PathologyGAN (PCA)**   | 0.43    | 0.548                    | -                   |
| **PathologyGAN (UMAP)**  | 0.43    | 0.6147                   | -                   |

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates the importance of dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithm selection in high-dimensional data analysis:
- **UMAP** outperformed PCA in producing well-defined clusters and higher V-Measure scores.
- **Hierarchical Clustering** paired with UMAP was the most consistent and effective approach, particularly for the VGG16 dataset.
- **K-Means** performed adequately but struggled with non-spherical cluster shapes.
- **Louvain Clustering** excelled in fine-grained clustering with optimal resolution tuning.

These findings highlight the interplay between dimensionality reduction techniques, clustering algorithms, and parameter optimization in achieving robust clustering performance.
